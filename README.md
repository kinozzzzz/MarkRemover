# MarkRemover
## Info
A scrpit for removing the mark after editing by [UPDF](https://updf.com/)

## Usage

```bash
python main.py file
```

`file` is the file you want to remove the mark of UPDF

## Matters

my program strategy is to overwrite the source file, so if you don't want so, you can change `file` argument in line 21
